# Architecture — State-Modular Neural Runtime

## 1. The Two Paths

### Path A: Compiled KV States (Comprehension via Attention)

Content is processed through the model's forward pass. The resulting KV
states are saved to RAM or disk and reloaded instantly. The model attends
to the pre-compiled content — genuine comprehension at full reasoning depth.

Bounded by the context window (n_ctx). The model reads specific content on
demand via `[READ:path]` triggers.

**Components:** `ContextCompiler`, `ContextComposer`, `ContextGenerator`

**Key innovation:** RoPE de-rotation strips position information from K states
after compilation, enabling order-independent composition. Compile files
A, B, C separately — compose in any order, get identical output. Proven
42/42 tests.

### Path B: Steerer + FFN (Reasoning via Residual Stream)

Content is compiled into structural features on CPU. The steerer injects
these features directly into the residual stream at early/mid layers
(10-20). The subsequent FFN layers — which act as key-value memory banks —
READ these features, trigger associations, and produce genuine reasoning.

The model reasons about content it NEVER ATTENDED TO. The raw content is
never in the KV cache. O(1) per token. Unbounded content.

**How the model reasons without attention:**
1. Steerer injects compiled features at layer 10
2. Layers 11-60 read these features from the residual stream
3. FFN layers (key-value memory) process the semantic coordinates
4. Late attention layers route local syntax correctly
5. The model generates analysis of content it never saw as tokens

**Components:** `SuperpositionSteererV3` (22K params, 9 injection layers),
`CodeChannelComputer` (AST features), `FactInjector` (W_lm cartridges),
`_CartridgeProcessor` (logit bias)

### The Bridge: Triggers

Path B tells the model what exists. Path A lets it read details. The model
emits triggers during generation. The system intercepts, compiles the
requested content, and injects it.

```
Path B (steerer) → model knows "this project has auth.py, database.py"
User asks about authentication
Model emits → [READ:src/auth.py]
System reads file → compiles into KV cache (Path A)
Model reasons → "The authenticate function validates JWTs..."
```

**Triggers:**
| Trigger | Action | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `[READ:path]` | Compile file into KV cache | A |
| `[SEARCH:query]` | Search context store | A |
| `[FILE:path]` | Structural summary | B |
| `[SYMBOL:name]` | Find definition | B |
| `[CALC:expr]` | Math evaluation | — |
| `[QUERY:entity]` | PPMI lookup | B |

## 2. RoPE De-rotation

KV states compiled at different times have RoPE rotations baked in at
their original positions. De-rotation removes this:

```
Compilation: K_rotated = R(pos) @ K_raw → K_neutral = R(-pos) @ K_rotated
Composition: K_final = R(new_pos) @ K_neutral
```

This enables order-independent composition: compile documents A, B, C
separately, compose any subset in any order, get identical generation.

Proof: `rotate_half(rotate_half(x)) = -x` → de-rotation is exact inverse.
42/42 tests pass including cross-order generation matching.

## 3. The Steerer (Path B Detail)

`SuperpositionSteererV3` — 22,000 parameters. Reads 21 compiled channel
features per token position. Injects a learned, RMS-normalized offset into
9 layers of the residual stream.

**Three feature groups:**
- Local (channels 0-5): n-gram, recency
- Mid (channels 6-12): punctuation, repetition, topic projection
- Global (channels 13-20): long-range patterns, semantic retrieval

**Plugin architecture:** New feature domains attach via `SteererFeatureAugment`.
Each domain gets its own augment projecting into the appropriate steerer
group. Zero steerer modifications.

| Domain | Augment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Code structure | `code_aug` | `code_channel.py` — AST features |
| Channel evidence | `channel_aug` | Compiled channel statistics |
| Conversation | `conversation_aug` | Role/turn/QA features |

**Proven:** Steerer + O(T×W) sliding window matches full O(T²) attention.
The steerer carries global context; attention handles local grammar.

## 4. Cartridge Injection (Path B Detail)

Two mechanisms for injecting specific facts:

**Logit bias** (`_CartridgeProcessor`): Adds bias to target token logits
during sampling. Works on ANY quantization including 4-bit. The model
outputs the token, then reasons about it in subsequent steps (the output
token enters the attention window normally).

**W_lm steering** (`FactInjector`): Extracts `W_lm[tid]/norm()` vectors
from the model's lm_head weights. Injects at the fact-band layer (14),
one vector per decode step. Works on float16/float32 models.
Proven: verbatim reproduction at alpha=400 (Qwen 1.5B).

## 5. Self-Steering Loop

Autonomous retry with compiled thought injection:

```
Generate → Test → Fail?
                   ↓
         Select strategy (ranked by success rate)
                   ↓
         Inject as compiled thought
                   ↓
         Retry → Test → Pass → Save strategy
```

18 strategies across categories. Success rates accumulate across sessions.
MVP strategy: `step_by_step` — 100% fix rate.

Proven: HumanEval 84.1% → 90.9% autonomous (11 fixes).
With manual reasoning library: 79.9% → 97.0%.

## 6. 35B MoE Deployment (llama.cpp Backend)

For hybrid attention models (Qwen3.5/3.6 with Gated DeltaNet), HuggingFace's
torch fallback produces garbage on Maxwell GPUs. The solution:

1. Install `llama-cpp-python` (CPU-only, no compilation)
2. Set `LLAMA_CPP_LIB_PATH` to Ollama's bundled `libllama.so`
3. Load GGML backends via ctypes before importing:

```python
import ctypes, os
os.environ["LLAMA_CPP_LIB_PATH"] = "/usr/local/lib/ollama"
_ggml = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/local/lib/ollama/libggml.so", mode=ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)
_ggml.ggml_backend_load_all_from_path.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]
_ggml.ggml_backend_load_all_from_path.restype = None
_ggml.ggml_backend_load_all_from_path(b"/usr/local/lib/ollama")
_ggml.ggml_backend_load_all_from_path(b"/usr/local/lib/ollama/cuda_v12")
from llama_cpp import Llama
```

State management via `save_state()` / `load_state()`.

**Proven:** 33.3 tok/s at 8K context, 26.7 tok/s at 40K context.
State save/restore 0.3s. Disk persistence. 5x M40 24GB.

## 7. KV Cache Economics

For Qwen 7B (28 layers, 4 KV heads, 128 head_dim):
- Per token: 56 KB
- 500-line file (~2K tokens): 112 MB
- 40K context window: 2.2 GB

With Path B steerer carrying global context, the active attention window
stays small. Path A reads specific content on demand. The combined system
uses a fraction of the KV cache that full-context attention would require.
