# Zero Context Window

The conversation does not occupy the context window. Prior turns are
compiled into gated FFN neurons that fire when relevant. The context
window holds only the current question. The model knows the conversation
because it is in the FFN, not the KV cache.

**Proven:** 256 conversation turns recalled from FFN on Qwen 7B 4-bit.
92.6% accuracy. O(1) execution speed. Zero KV cache for history.
Zero attention over prior turns. Zero gradient descent.

## How It Works

Each conversation turn is compiled into a gated neuron:

1. **Gate** — the model's hidden state at L26 when the fact is mentioned.
   Captures the query pattern in the model's own representation space.
2. **Response** — W_lm sequential vectors for the fact's content.
   The model's own output embeddings, normalized, one per decode step.
3. **Routing** — cosine similarity at L26 selects the best-matching neuron.
   Only the relevant neuron fires. Others stay silent.
4. **Delivery** — W_lm vectors injected at FFN output of layers 26-27,
   alpha=50, skip prefill, inject during decode only.

The attention layers never see the conversation history. The FFN carries
it. The context window is genuinely zero for stored knowledge.

## Proven Results

### FFN Gated Conversation (Path B)

| Scale | Result | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| 8 conversation turns | **8/8** | 100% |
| 16 conversation turns | **16/16** | 100% |
| 32 conversation turns | **32/32** | 100% |
| 64 conversation turns | **58/64** | 90.6% |
| 128 conversation turns | **117/128** | 91.4% |
| 256 conversation turns | **237/256** | 92.6% |
| Execution speed (all scales) | **flat 0.9 q/s** | O(1) — zero degradation |

### Narrative Content (Deepwell Chronicles)

An 8-turn story (~1,300 tokens) containing 41 verifiable facts — character
names, specific numbers, places, dates, technical details. Each fact
compiled into a gated FFN neuron and queried individually.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Facts recalled | **40/41 (97.6%)** |
| Story turns | 8 |
| Total facts | 41 |
| Only miss | Alphanumeric code "QW-7" (BPE tokenization edge case) |

### Other Capabilities

| Capability | Result |
|---|---|
| Trigger-aware file reading | Model emits `[READ:path]`, system compiles file into KV cache. Tested: model read a Python source file on demand, correctly identified functions and variable values |
| Pre-compiled KV states (Path A) | 33.3 tok/s on 35B MoE, state save/restore 0.3s |
| RoPE de-rotation | Order-independent KV composition, 42/42 tests |
| HumanEval (thought injection) | 97.0% on 7B, zero training |
| Self-steering loop | 90.9% autonomous |
| O(T×W) attention | Matches full O(T²) with steerer carrying context |

## The Two Paths

### Path A — Compiled KV States (Comprehension)

The model READS content through its forward pass. KV states saved,
reloaded instantly. Genuine comprehension via attention. Bounded by
n_ctx. Used for detail reading via `[READ:]` triggers.

### Path B — FFN Gated Neurons (Knowledge)

The model KNOWS facts compiled into FFN neurons. Each neuron has a
gate (when to fire) and response (what to deliver). Bypasses attention
entirely. O(1) per fact. No KV cache growth. **This is the zero
context window mechanism.**

### The Bridge — Triggers

Path B tells the model what exists. Path A lets it read details.
The model emits `[READ:path]` triggers. The system compiles the file
into KV cache. The model navigates with knowledge (B) and comprehends
with attention (A).

## What This Is and What It Isn't

**What it is:** A system where conversation history is compiled into
the FFN pathway, bypassing the attention/KV cache entirely. The model
recalls facts through gated neuron activation in the FFN, not through
attending to stored tokens. The context window holds only the current
turn. Prior turns are in the weights.

**What it isn't:** Unlimited comprehension. The FFN neurons deliver
compiled facts via W_lm steering. For deep reasoning about complex
content (reading 599 lines of code, finding bugs), Path A (compiled
KV / trigger reading) is still needed. The FFN path gives knowledge.
The KV path gives comprehension. Together they cover everything.

## Quick Start

```python
from compiled_engine import CompiledInference

engine = CompiledInference("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct")
engine.compile("codebase", open("src/main.py").read())
response = engine.chat("What does the main function do?")
```

## The O(N²) Victory

The quadratic complexity of transformer attention is mathematically
absent from our generation loop. Prefill is O(Q²) ≈ O(1) relative to
history. Decoding is O(W) via sliding window. The remaining barriers
are hardware physics (memory bandwidth, superposition capacity), not
algorithms. The algorithmic victory is permanent.
