# State-Modular Neural Runtime

A system that treats the transformer's KV cache as a warm-loadable,
addressable memory register. Content is compiled into reusable neural
activations, stored in system RAM, and loaded directly into the attention
path — dropping first-token latency to near-zero and offloading the
prompt-processing budget to cheap system RAM.

## What This Is

A **zero-prefill architecture** that bypasses three costs of standard inference:

1. **Bypassed: Dynamic prefill** — The O(N²) forward pass that generates
   initial K/V matrices is executed once, the activations are extracted,
   RoPE coordinates are stripped (de-rotation), and the result is written
   to RAM. Never recomputed.

2. **Bypassed: Absolute RoPE positioning** — De-rotated keys can be
   recomposed in any order and re-sequentialized on the fly without
   another forward pass. 42/42 composition tests pass.

3. **Bypassed: Active KV cache growth** — A sliding window enforces
   constant active cache size during generation. New tokens don't grow
   the cache quadratically.

## What This Is NOT

The attention step is still physically active. During decoding, the query
vector of each generated token calculates dot-product similarity against
every key in the composed `past_key_values` tensor. The context window is
populated via fast RAM transfer instead of dynamic forward pass, but it is
still present and queried by the attention heads.

**The model's active knowledge is bounded by GPU VRAM.** At ~56 KB/token
for a 7B model, compiled state scales linearly. This system shifted the
memory bottleneck from expensive GPU compute to passive RAM/disk storage.
It did not eliminate the storage footprint.

**Independently compiled states lack cross-attention.** File A's KV states
don't reflect awareness of File B. The model bridges them through its
active attention during decoding, not through pre-computed cross-file
relationships.

## Proven Results

| What | Result | Hardware |
|---|---|---|
| Compiled state recall | 4/4 facts across 4 queries from saved state | RTX 3080, 5x M40 |
| Prefill elimination | 0ms from saved state (vs minutes for 1M+ tokens) | RTX 3080 |
| RoPE de-rotation | Order-independent composition, 42/42 tests | RTX 3080 |
| 35B MoE generation | 33.3 tok/s with state save/restore | 5x M40 24GB |
| Retrieval + compile | 100K corpus, 5ms CPU search, 32 tok/s generation | 5x M40 24GB |
| HumanEval (thought injection) | 97.0% (7B model, zero training) | RTX 3080 |
| HumanEval (self-steering) | 90.9% autonomous | RTX 3080 |

### The 1.58M Token Test

This was retrieval + compilation, not the model holding 1.58M tokens in
state. A CPU text search found the needle in 33ms. The relevant chunk was
compiled into 21 MB of active KV. The model answered from that chunk at
30 tok/s. The system accessed 1.58M tokens. The model knew ~200 tokens.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python compiled_chat.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

# Commands:
#   /compile_file src/main.py
#   /compiled
#   "Explain the main function"
```

### API Server

```bash
python compiled_server.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --port 8000

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/compile \
  -d '{"id": "facts", "text": "The planet Zargthorp has 3 moons."}'

curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the moons of Zargthorp?"}]}'
```

### Programmatic

```python
from compiled_engine import CompiledInference

engine = CompiledInference("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct")
engine.compile("codebase", open("src/main.py").read())
response = engine.chat("What does the main function do?")
engine.save("./compiled_states/")
engine.load("./compiled_states/")
```

## Architecture

1. **Compiler** (`ContextCompiler`) — Forward pass on content, saves KV
   states to CPU RAM. RoPE de-rotation stores position-neutral keys.

2. **Composer** (`ContextComposer`) — Selects compiled states, assigns
   sequential positions, re-rotates keys, loads to GPU.

3. **Generator** (`ContextGenerator`) — Generates from composed state.
   Zero prefill latency.

### Control Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Compiled KV states | Pre-compute content, reload instantly |
| 2 | System-role compilation | Compile behavioral directives into KV |
| 3 | Multi-layer steering | Override trained facts via W_lm at 9 layers |
| 4 | Logit bias | Verbatim reproduction on quantized models |
| 5 | Thought injection | Inject reasoning hints mid-generation |

### Self-Steering Loop

Generate → test → on failure, select strategy from ranked library →
inject as thought → retry. 18 strategies, success rates tracked across
sessions.
